AVR sample project for AVR (AT90CAN128, but it should not be difficult to target 
To build the example, you can use makefile or an AVR Studio project.

[Makefile]
* you should adapt your OIL file to your specific installation of avr-gcc (COMPILER, LINKER and ASSEMBLER keys in the CPU/OS section).
* Then build oil related generated .c and .h files and the Makefile:
goil --target=avr -g --templates=../../goil/templates/ firstAVR.oil
(The generated file .aps is an AVR Studio project for Windows users).
* and build the project:
make
Both a .elf and a .hex files are generated. goil will now be called directly from the Makefile if the .ol file is updated.

[AVR Studio]
An AVR studio project is generated directly by goil from the .oil file. So User application source file SHOULD be given in the .oil file (CPU/OS section). The Goil.exe OIL compiler should be in your PATH (in the project directory for instance).
* run the 'createProject.bat' script file. It will generate both a Makefile and an AVR Studio file.
* Then use the AVR Studio IDE to edit your project, compile and Run!
* Each time that the .oil file is updated, DO NOT FORGET to run Goil to update data structures! This should be made with the 'runGoil.bat' script. 
* NOTE: if you call the 'createProject.bat' script, your project file will be overwritten.
(The only specific thing in the AVR Studio project settings is related to include directories paths)
